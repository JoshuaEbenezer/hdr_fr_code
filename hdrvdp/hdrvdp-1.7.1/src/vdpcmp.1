.TH "vdpcmp" 1
.SH NAME
vdpcmp \- Compare two images using Visual Difference Predicator (low level command)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vdpcmp
<target_file> <mask_file> [--ldr]  [--mask <val>] [--psycho <val>] [--detection-mechanism <dmID>] [--no-phase-uncertainty] [--dump <pattern>] [--verbose] [--help] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command processes a pair of images using Visual Difference
Predicator and writes a map of probability detection to standard
output. It is more convenient to use 'vdp' instead of this command, as
it can handle image format conversion.

\fB<target_file>\fR is the file name of an image for which detection
probability should be computed (e.g. distorted image) and
\fB<mask_file>\fR is the file name of an image that is a reference
(e.g. original, not distorted). The order in which both images are
passed to the vdp is important and may affect the results.

The format of input images and output map is pfs. Use one of the
readers from pfstools package to read images into vdpcmp.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \--ldr

Use the original (non high dynamic range) version of the VDP. Since
the original VDP has not been maintained for ages, this option is
\fIdepreciated\fR. HDR VDP should provide better results and can work with
LDR images as well.

.TP
.B \--multiply-lum <val>

Multiply luminance values of both target and mask by <val>. Using such
multiplier is necessary if the images contain only relative but not
absolute luminance values (cd/m^2). In case of low dynamic range
images that have been converted from sRGB color space to XYZ
(\fB--linear\fR switch of \fBpfsinppm\fR), \fB--multiply-lum\fR should
be set to the maximum luminance of the display (see also man page of
\fBvdp\fR).

.TP
.B \--mask <val>
Set the slope of the masking function to <val>. Default 1.


.TP
.B \--psycho <val>
Set the slope of the psychometric function to <val>. Default 3.5.

.TP
.B \--peak-contrast <contrast>
The peak sensitivity of the visual system given as minimum
distinguishable contrast. The value must be given as a fraction, not
percent!. Default value: 0.006 (=0.6%)

.TP
.B \--otf <otfID>
Name of the optical tranfer function (OTF, or PSF of the eye). Possible
values:

.B DEELEY 
(default) - OTF from 'Deeley, R.J., Drasdo, N., & Charman,
W. N. (1991). A simple parametric model of the human ocular modulation
transfer function. Ophthalmology and Physiological Optics, 11,
91-93'. It takes into account pupil size, which depends on adaptation
luminance. This is suggested OTF function for the VDP.

.B MARIMONT
- OTF from 'Marimont D.H. and Wandell B.A., 1994. Matching colour
images; the effects of axial chromatic aberration. Journal of the
Optical Society of America A, 11 (no 12) 2113-3122'. It takes into
account pupil size, which depends on adaptation luminance. (note: the
integration performed in the current implementation is not
accurate. This can lead to artifacts in the filtered image).

.B SPENCER
- PSF from Spencer et al. SIGGRAPH'95 paper 

.B NORMANN
- PSF from Normann et al. IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man and Cybernetics '83 paper (note: this function can be wrong (typo in the paper?), therefore it is not recommended to use it).

.B WESTHEIMER
- PSF from Westheimer "The eye as an optical instrument" in Handbook of Perception and Visual Performance. This function is also used in Sarnoff Visual Discrimination Model.

.B NONE
- no OTF preprecessing 


.TP
.B \--detection-mechanism <dmID>
Name of the detection mechanism to use. Currently supported:

.B WATSON, VDP
- Watson cortex transform (default)

.B SIMPLE
- no multichannel processing, only a single channel

.TP
.B \--no-abs-fix

VDP can predict visible differences for pixels that are identical
because of inaccuracies of visual band filters. To avoid this, as a
final step HDR VDP compares two input images pixel by pixel and if the
corresponding pixels are almost identical (difference < 0.0001), it
sets the prediction for that pixel to 0. Use \fB--no-abs-fix\fR to
disable this behavior.

.TP
.B \--dump <pattern>
Dump intermediate images resulting from VDP processing. The pattern
specifies names of the files to dump. A shell pattern ('*' is a wild
card character) can be used to dump many frames. The option can be
specified many times to dump additional images. All images are dumped
in pfs format. Some available dump images are listed below. More can
be found in the sources.

.TP
.B \--no-phase-uncertainty
Phase uncertainty improves the prediction of visual masking by
discounting the influence of phase from the masking thresholds. By
default, phase uncertainty is included in the VDP calculation. However
it almost doubles time required to process an image. This switch can
be used to turn off computation of phase uncertainty.

.PP
The following options define viewing conditions. Because passing a
complete set of options to specify viewing conditions is rather
tedious, the better way is to use \fB-vc\fR option of the \fIvdp\fR
command (see the man page for vdp).

.TP
.B \--display-width \--display-height
Physical dimensions of the display given in meters. Default: width
0.375 height 0.300.

.TP
.B \--min-distance \--max-distance
Minimum and maximum distance from which the display is
observed. Default: min 0.5 max 0.5.

.TP
.B \--display-x-resolution \--display-y-resolution
Vertical and horizontal resolution of the display given in
pixels. Default: horizontal 1280 vertical 1024.
