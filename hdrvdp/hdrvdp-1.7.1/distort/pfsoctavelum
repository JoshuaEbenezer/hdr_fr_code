Execute octave script to modify luminance channel of the pfs stream

Usage: pfsoctavelum <script>

Where <script> is an Octave script. Luminance channel is passed to the
script as matrix Y. Color channnels X, Z and modified proportionally
to Y.

Example:
  > pfsin pokoj.hdr | pfsoctavelum 'Y = Y * 240' | \
     pfsout pokoj_calibrated.hdr

To multiply values of luminance by 240.
